The results generated by the variable selection method are stored in this directory. 

- Within the [pValues](./pValues/) folder we store the p-values computed using different count data models. 
The p-values are compressed with gzip and images are provided as visual reference for the distribution of p-values for each pair of cities (beware: bad models produce significant changes).

- Within [integrated_tables](./integrated_tables/) you can find the OTUs tables constructed with the model selection. 
Each one of them contains an ID column that specifies the OTU selected and its taxonomic level. 

- Finally, in [significant_otus](./significant_otus/), the 5 most significant OTUs under a given count data model are saved. 
There one can see which OTUs help distinguish between each pair of cities.
