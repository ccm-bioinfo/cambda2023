# Reproducible code

### Docker

To ensure reproducibility, we have created a Docker image, which you can pull
by running:

```bash
docker pull aapashkov/camda2023:latest
```

You may then run it with:

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged -itv $(pwd):/home aapashkov/camda2023
```

The Docker image has the micromamba package manager installed, and contains
several conda and Python virtual environments whose spec files are located in
the [`Dependencies/`](https://github.com/ccm-bioinfo/cambda2023/tree/main/07_reproducible_code/Dependencies)
directory. Here, each `[filename].yml` is treated as a conda spec file to
produce a conda virtual environment called `[filename]`, which can be
activated by running `micromamba activate [filename]`; for example, to activate
the `rgi` environment produced by `rgi.yml`, run `micromamba activate rgi`. On
the other hand, each `[filename].txt` is read as a Python requirements.txt file
that produces Python virtual environments in `/root/[filename]/`, thus making
its activation possible by running `source /root/[filename]/bin/activate`; for
instance, you can activate the `data-science` environment defined by
`data-science.txt` by executing `source /root/data-science/bin/activate`.

The `/root/` directory of the Docker image contains this entire git repository
cloned into `git/`, and is automatically updated (i.e., pulled) each time the
Docker image is run. Further, if the Docker is run as specified above, your
current working directory will be mounted at `/home/`.

There are three main folders: Data, Scripts, and Outputs. For each piece of code referenced in the article, there is a completely reproducible script in the Scripts folder. For each document in the Scripts folder, there is a corresponding text file in the Data folder and a folder in the Outputs folder (named after the script) where you can find links to each dataframe used in the script and all the outputs generated by the script, respectively.
## Metapangenomics Analysis
In the folder scripts you can find an other folder called [**MASTERS_SCRIPTS** ](https://github.com/ccm-bioinfo/cambda2023/tree/main/07_reproducible_code/Scripts/MASTER_SCRIPTS) this folder contains all scripts used for the metapangenomics analysis. On the other hand, if you wish to see the workflow of this analysis. You can visit the next [link](https://github.com/ccm-bioinfo/cambda2023/blob/main/06_amr_resistance/readme_pangenoma.md)
