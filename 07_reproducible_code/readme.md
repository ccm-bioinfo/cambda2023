# Reproducible code

There are three main folders: Data, Scripts, and Outputs. For each piece of code referenced in the article, there is a completely reproducible script in the Scripts folder. For each document in the Scripts folder, there is a corresponding text file in the Data folder and a folder in the Outputs folder (named after the script) where you can find links to each dataframe used in the script and all the outputs generated by the script, respectively.
