# Reproducible code

There are three main folders: Data, Scripts, and Outputs. For each piece of code referenced in the article, there is a completely reproducible script in the Scripts folder. For each document in the Scripts folder, there is a corresponding text file in the Data folder and a folder in the Outputs folder (named after the script) where you can find links to each dataframe used in the script and all the outputs generated by the script, respectively.
## Metapangenomics Analysis
In the folder scripts you can find an other folder called [**MASTERS_SCRIPTS** ](https://github.com/ccm-bioinfo/cambda2023/tree/main/07_reproducible_code/Scripts/MASTER_SCRIPTS) this folder contains all scripts used for the metapangenomics analysis. On the other hand, if you wish to see the workflow of this analysis. You can visit the next [link](https://github.com/ccm-bioinfo/cambda2023/blob/main/06_amr_resistance/readme_pangenoma.md)
